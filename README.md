# CS-320-Project
My CS-320 SNHU project

I can make sure that my code is functional and secure by thoroughly testing things like Tasks in a program, Contacts and Appointment info by using a testing tool such as JUnit testing to make sure that my code is safe, secure, and bug free.

I interpret user needs into my program by adjusting my program to fit said needs. I do this by adding and testing new features, tweaking them to user needs for a better experience.

I approach designing software by first creating a blueprint. This blueprint is usually from what a users needs are, and then I can create and test the code from there, adding on changes and tweaking my code as I go on to better fit the user (and coder) experience.
